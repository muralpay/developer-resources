### Business KYC Requirements

After creating a new Organization of type 'business', the documentation outlines required KYC information:

Key Required Information:
* Legal business name
* Business entity type
* Formation date
* Website
* Registered Business Address
* Primary Operating Address
   * Requires Proof of Address
* Business Formation Document (e.g. Articles of Incorporation)
* Tax Identification Number
* Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs)
   * Individuals owning >20% of entity
   * Each UBO subject to Individual KYC
* Source of Funds details

Additional Notes:
- KYC requirements may evolve over time
- Regulatory changes will be communicated to Developers
- Detailed compliance information available in referenced documentation

Reference Links:
- [Proof of Address Requirements](https://docs.muralpay.com/articles/2962171586-business-identity-verification)
- [Business Formation Document Guide](https://docs.muralpay.com/articles/6684235589-business-formation-document-guide)
- [Business Ownership Guide](https://docs.muralpay.com/articles/3930138118-business-ownership-documents-guide)
- [Security Compliance Details](https://docs.muralpay.com/articles/4656194579-security-compliance)

### Client Custodial Model

In the **Client Custodial Model**, youâ€”the Developerâ€”retain custody of funds on behalf of the Organizations you manage through the API. When using the Payouts API, your [Transfer API Key](https://developers.muralpay.com/docs/get-api-key#/transfer-api-key) serves as the authorization mechanism to initiate and move funds from managed Accounts.

<br />

> ðŸ“˜ Note
>
> "Mural does not take custody of any funds managed through the API. As a Developer, you are solely responsible for securing your API keys."

### Custody Models

The documentation describes two payment integration models for the Mural Pay API:

1. Client Custodial
2. End-User Custodial

Key points:
- Developers must choose a model based on their "regulatory requirements and compliance posture"
- Mural Pay recommends consulting legal counsel for model selection
- The document provides a comparison of technical implications between models

Notable quote: "Mural Pay does not provide legal advice regarding the choice of custody model."

The page emphasizes that the developer is responsible for selecting an appropriate integration approach that meets their specific business needs and regulatory environment.

### End-User Custody Model

In the **End-User Custody Model**, the End User retains full custody and control over the funds held in their [Account(s)](https://developers.muralpay.com/docs/account#/). When onboarding an [Organization](https://developers.muralpay.com/docs/customers#/), you will prompt the End User to configure email-based authentication linked to their Mural Account. This authentication is required to explicitly approve all outbound payouts from their Account(s).

This model removes youâ€”the Developerâ€”from the flow of funds. Without explicit approval from the End User, you cannot initiate payouts or move funds from their Account.

### Individual KYC Requirements

The documentation outlines KYC (Know Your Customer) information requirements for individual organizations, which include:

* Full legal name
* Date of Birth
* Contact Information
  * Email Address
  * Phone Number
* Primary Residential Address
  * Proof of Address (linked to external requirements document)
* Government-issued Identification Document
* Nationality
* Tax Identification Number (e.g. SSN)

The document notes that "Mural's KYC information requests may change over time" and that updates will be communicated to developers. A link to additional compliance and security documentation is provided.

Key observation: The requirements are comprehensive and cover personal identification, contact, and tax-related information for individual organizational users.

### Supporting Details Requirements

To comply with regulatory and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements, Mural may require additional supporting details for certain Payouts.

If supporting documentation is required, the following process applies:

1. Attempt to [create a Payout Request](https://developers.muralpay.com/reference/createpayoutrequest#/) as normal.
2. If supporting documentation is needed, you will receive an error response with an error name indicating that the `supportingDetails` field in the API request body is required.
3. Update your Payout Request to include a `supportingDetails` object with the following fields:
   1. `supportingDocument` â€” A base64-encoded data URI containing a document that demonstrates the purpose of the payout or source of funds. Accepted document types include invoices, receipts, contracts, signed agreements, or statements of work. The document must clearly reference the payout transaction and include the recipient's name, payout amount, and description of goods or services.
   2. `payoutPurpose` â€” A string describing the reason for the payout. Refer to the [Payouts](https://developers.muralpay.com/reference/createpayoutrequest#/) endpoint for available options.

When resubmitting the Payout Request, make sure to include the `supportingDetails` in the request body. The request will then be processed successfully.

<br />

> ðŸš§ Please ensure accurate & relevant information is provided
>
> Submitting incomplete or unrelated documents may result in payout delays. Transactions requiring additional documentation may be temporarily placed on hold while under review. A member of the Mural Compliance team will contact you via email if further clarification or documentation are needed.

### Generate API Keys

Key Documentation Points:

> ðŸ“˜ API Access Requirements
> - Contact support@muralpay.com
> - Complete KYC process
- Must have Business Organization to manage developer API keys

API Key Generation Process:
- Navigate to **Settings > Developers**
- Copy and save keys securely
- Full API key shown only once
- Can revoke/rotate keys from Developers tab

Two Required API Keys:

1. API Key (General)
   - Authenticates all API requests
   - Use Bearer Authentication in request header

2. Transfer API Key
   - Required for transactions and account creation
   - Needed for `/payouts/payout/execute` and `/payouts/payout/cancel` endpoints
   - Use `transfer-api-key` request header

Important Note: "Most likely the Account automatically provisioned will not be enabled for API use"

Recommendation: Create new Account via API

The documentation includes a screenshot demonstrating the API key generation interface.

                "bankBeneficiaryName": "Sun Tree Capital LLC",
                "bankBeneficiaryAddress"
```

### Get Organization KYC Status

The documentation explains how to check the KYC (Know Your Customer) status of an organization after creation by calling a GET endpoint.

## Key Components:

### Example Request
- Uses cURL to retrieve organization details
- Requires API key for authorization
- Endpoint: `https://api.muralpay.com/api/organizations/{organization-id}`

### Response Examples
Two possible response scenarios are shown:
1. KYC Approved
   - Includes organization details
   - Shows `kycStatus` as "approved"
   - Lists currency capabilities

2. KYC Rejected
   - Includes organization details
   - Shows `kycStatus` as "rejected"
   - Provides rejection reason

### Organization KYC Statuses
Possible statuses include:
- `INACTIVE`
- `PENDING`
- `APPROVED`
- `ERROR`
- `REJECTED`

### On-Behalf-Of Header
After KYC approval, users can perform operations for an organization by adding the `on-behalf-of` header to supported API endpoints.

The documentation provides example cURL commands and JSON response structures to demonstrate API usage for checking organization KYC status.

### Get the Payout Request Status

The documentation explains how to retrieve a payout request's status using an API endpoint. It includes:

## Key Sections:
1. Example API Request (curl command)
2. Example API Response (JSON)
3. Payout Request Statuses
4. Individual Payout Statuses

## Payout Request Statuses:
- `AWAITING_EXECUTION`

- `CANCELED`

## Blockchain Payout Statuses:
- `AWAITING_EXECUTION`
- `PENDING`
- `EXECUTED`
- `FAILED`
- `CANCELLED`

Important Note: "EXECUTED" status doesn't guarantee funds have been received for each individual payout.

Contact for support: support@muralpay.com

The documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and tracking payout request and individual payout statuses through the MuralPay API.

### Get Payout Fees

The documentation describes two API endpoints for fetching payout fees in the Payouts API:

1. Token to Fiat Endpoint
   - Allows specifying source token amount (USDC)
   - Calculates fees for converting tokens to fiat currency

2. Fiat to Token Endpoint
   - Allows specifying destination fiat currency amount
   - Calculates fees for converting fiat to tokens

Key Notes:
> "The destination fiat currency value provided is an estimate, as exchange rates are not locked until a payout is executed"

Endpoints:
- POST http://app.muralpay.com/api/payouts/fees/token-to-fiat
- POST http://app.muralpay.com/api/payouts/fees/fiat-to-token

Both endpoints require:
- API Key authorization
- JSON payload with token/fiat amount
- Specific currency and rail code (e.g., "cop" for Colombian Peso)

Response Details:
- Exchange rate
- Exchange fee percentage
- Minimum transaction value
- Transaction fee
- Estimated conversion amount

The documentation provides curl command examples and JSON response samples for both token-to-fiat and fiat-to-token scenarios.

### Main Overview

> ðŸ“˜ Getting Started
>
> Before getting started you will need to create a Mural Organization, complete KYB / KYC, and generate API keys.

The following pages walk you through the integration for enabling a cross-border payment leveraging the Mural API. The process for making a payment via the API follows three core steps, as outlined in the diagram below.

![Diagram of payment process steps](https://files.readme.io/71972eb5b5ff41a47036eb6092926b6f2448a626d3c0d085257c8e3b69557d7b-image.png)

<br />

1. **Create an Organization** - Leverage the [Organizations API](../reference/createorganization) to register your end-user with Mural. Upon KYB / KYC approval, an Account will be provisioned for the Organization.
2. **Deposit Funds into an Account** - Use the [Accounts API](../reference/getaccount) to fetch deposit details / instructions, and fund a Customer's balance with USD or USDC. See the [Sandbox Environment documentation](./sandbox-environment) for how to fund accounts in our sandbox.
3. **Create & Execute a Payout Request** - Use the [Payouts API](../reference/createpayoutrequest) to create and execute a payment on behalf of the Organization. Payments can be made via fiat to bank accounts or to digital wallets via stablecoins.

<br />

Follow the steps in the following pages to integrate the end-to-end flow.

### Accept Terms of Service

> ðŸ“˜ Note
>
> In order to perform any operations with the API, Terms of Service must be accepted by your user. All endpoints in the API will throw a special error if Terms of Service have not been accepted.

After creating an Organization, you can check the status of whether or not the Terms of Service have been accepted.

#### Example request

```shell Get organization
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.muralpay.com/api/organizations/807742f0-e76c-44cd-bbe9-30b02e0060f4 \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $API-KEY'
```

#### Example response

```json Terms of Service No Accepted
{
    "type": "business",
    "name": "Sun Tree Capital Llc",
    "id": "807742f0-e76c-44cd-bbe9-30b02e0060f4",
    "createdAt": "2025-04-04T16:32:17.074Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-04-04T16:36:00.592Z",
    "kycStatus": {

    },
    "tosStatus": NOT_ACCEPTED,
    "currencyCapabilities": [
        {
            "fiatAndRailCode": "usd",
            "currencyCode": "USD",
            "depositStatus": {
                "type": "enabled"
            },
            "payOutStatus": {
                "type": "enabled"
            }
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
```json Terms of Service Accepted
{
    "type": "business",
    "name": "Sun Tree Capital Llc",
    "id": "807742f0-e76c-44cd-bbe9-30b02e0060f4",
    "createdAt": "2025-04-04T16:32:17.074Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-04-04T16:36:00
```

### Accounts

Accounts are used to store and manage funds. They are used when making deposits or fund payouts.

Each Account has both a wallet address and a set of "pay in methods" which outline the various ways in which you can pay into (fund) your Account. The supported pay in methods are:

1. **Digital wallet**: transfer via the Account's wallet address. Cannot initiate payins via the Payins API for digital wallet transactions.
2. **USD**: ACH or Wire funds to the Account. Cannot initiate payins via the Payins API for USD.
3. **EUR**: SEPA transfer funds to the Account. Cannot initiate payins via the Payins API for EUR.
4. **COP**: Directly fund the Account via a generated PSE or Nequi link using the Payins API.

Upon successful KYC of your Organization, an Account will be created automatically. Additional Accounts can be created via the Accounts API.

> ðŸš§ Note
>
> "Mural does not have access to or the ability to move funds to/from these Accounts."

An image is also included in the documentation, showing a screenshot related to Accounts.

### Organizations

An Organization represents your end usersâ€”the individuals or businesses who own the funds for which you are facilitating payments. Organizations have two types:

* Individual - an individual user / natural person.
* Business - a registered business entity / company.

Creating an Organization for your end user [via the Organizations API ](../reference/createorganization)is the first step to enabling seamless cross-boarder payouts from or to your end users' wallets or bank accounts.

<Image align="center" width="700px" src="https://files.readme.io/104e4d6812c02ae428e62322327bf7cdaaa7abec05e2cd721b8aad8404d8add6-Screenshot_2025-07-16_at_10.04.56_AM.png" />

<br />

When creating an Organization, you must provide KYC information, which can be submitted either via a hosted KYC link. Mural performs KYC checks, ensuring secure transfers and regulatory compliance. Required information includes details like name, email, and tax identification numbers. For a complete list of onboarding requirements, please visit the [KYC Requirements documentation.](individual-kyc-requirements)

### Payins

Payins (deposits) represent a single inflow of funds into Mural. You can initiate a Payin into your Mural Account in one of two ways: via an external transfer to the provided payin method details or via the <Anchor label="Payins API" target="_blank" href="../reference/createpayin">Payins API</Anchor>. With a combination of the two methods, you will be able to provide seamless, exhaustive payin functionality into your Accounts.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
>
> Not all Payin methods are supported via the Payins API and require a transfer to be initiated outside of Mural. Please see Payins API documentation for more details.

A Payin contains two parts: the "sent currency" and the "destination token." If the "sent currency" is a fiat currency, upon receipt, Mural will convert that fiat currency into the "destination token" and blockchain of choice. If the "sent currency" is a token (i.e., USDC or USDT), that token will be directly credited to your Account.

<Image align="center" border={false} caption="1. User initiates a fiat transfer (e.g, ACH or Wire for USD) 2. Fiat converted into USDC/T and Account balance is credited" src="https://files.readme.io/1f7e62f42429970c861b1d8cc34019218141b2c10f7d03601cf80d58b0c7751d-Screenshot_2025-07-16_at_10.37.05_AM.png" width="700px" />

### Payouts

The documentation describes Payouts as "a single outflow of funds in Mural" that can be initiated through a Payout Request. Key details include:

- Requires specifying a source Account, amount, and recipient payment details
- Can be processed via [Payouts API](../reference/createpayoutrequest)
- Two payout types:
  1. **FIAT** (currencies like EUR, MXN, USD, BRL, COP) to external Bank Account
  2. **BLOCKCHAIN** (USDC / USDT) to digital wallet

The page includes a centered screenshot illustrating the payout process, with an image width of 700px.

Additional reference is made to the [Fiat Rail Code](./fiat-currency-and-rail-codes) documentation for detailed fiat payout construction guidance.

### Transactions

A **Transaction** represents the movement of funds in or out of an Account. Each Transaction is categorized as either a **Deposit** or a **Payout**.

### Transaction Types

**Payin (Deposit)**

A Payin is an inflow of funds into a Mural Account. This occurs when funds are deposited into the Account, adding to its balance. Payin transactions can have the following statuses:

* AWAITING_FUNDS: the deposit has been created, but funds have not been received from the sender.
* COMPLETED: funds have been received and credited to your Account.

**Payout**

A Payout is an outflow of funds from a Mural Account. This occurs when funds are disbursed from the account, reducing its balance. More information for the Payout associated with the Transaction can be retrieved from the [Payouts API](../reference/getpayoutrequest). Payout status information can be found [here](./get-payout-request-status-copy#/payout-request-statuses).

### How to Access Transactions

### End-User Custodial Payout Orchestration

The document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing end-user custodial payouts using the Mural API and SDK. Key steps include:

1. Prerequisites:
- Install the Mural Browser SDK via npm
- Requires understanding of Mural API integration

2. Organization Creation:
- Create an organization with `endUserCustodialIndividual` or `endUserCustodialBusiness` type
- Specify approvers who can authorize payout requests

3. SDK Implementation:
- Mount an invisible iframe
- Initialize SDK using `createInstance()`
- Trigger authentication challenge
- Start a secure session with verification code

4. Payout Process:
- Retrieve payout request body
- Sign payload using SDK
- Execute payout request with signature

The guide includes detailed code examples for each step, covering curl commands and JavaScript/TypeScript implementations. It emphasizes security through a multi-step authentication and signing process.

Key technical components:
- SDK: `@muralpay/browser-sdk`
- API endpoints for organization, challenge, and payout execution
- Secure session management
- Public key and signature-based authentication

### End-User Custodial SDK Documentation

# API Reference

### Static Methods

#### `createInstance(config: EndUserCustodialSDKConfig): Promise<EndUserCustodialSDK>`

Creates and initializes the SDK instance.

```ts
const sdk = await EndUserCustodialSDK.createInstance(config);
```

### Instance Methods

#### `startSession(payload: StartSessionPayload): Promise<void>`

Starts the SDK session using the verification code and `authenticatorId`.

```ts
await sdk.startSession({
  code: 'email-code',
  authenticatorId: 'auth-id'
});
```

#### `getPublicKey(): string`

Returns the iframe public key to use in the challenge.

```ts
const publicKey = sdk.getPublicKey();
```

#### `signPayoutPayload(payload: any): Promise<string>`

Signs a payout transaction.

```ts
const signature = await sdk.signPayoutPayload(body);
```

#### `isSessionActive(): boolean`

Checks if a session is currently active.

```ts
if (sdk.isSessionActive()) {
  // Safe to proceed
}
```

#### `clearSession(): void`

Clears the session state.

```ts
sdk.clearSession();
```

#### `getClientSessionExpiry(): Date | null`

Returns the session's expiration time.

```ts
const expiry = sdk.getClientSessionExpiry();
```

## Full Usage Flow

```ts
// 1. Create SDK instance
const sdk = await EndUserCustodialSDK.createInstance({
  iframeContainerId: 'auth-iframe-container-id',
  iframeElement: document.getElementById('auth-iframe-container-id')
});

// 2. Get public key
const publicKey = sdk.getPublicKey();

// 3. Backend: trigger challenge with publicKey + user ID

// 4. User inputs email code â†’ start session
await sdk.startSession({
  code: codeFromUser,
  authenticatorId: authIdFromBackend
});

// 5. Backend: fetch /body-to-sign/:id
const signature = await
```

### End-User Custodial Resources

Content summary:
- Explains requirements for organizations without direct fund custody/transmission capabilities
- Instructs users to use "Mural's end-user custodial organizations and end-user custodial payout flow"
- Directs readers to additional documentation on "custody models"

Key quote: "If you do not have the ability to custody or transmit funds on behalf of your users, you must use Mural's end-user custodial organizations..."

Additional note: Includes a link reference to "[custody models documentation](./custody-models)"

The document provides guidance for organizations seeking to manage user funds through Mural's custodial infrastructure.

### Errors

The Mural API can throw various errors. If it is expected that an error from the Mural API should be handled gracefully, an error will be serialized to the http response as a `MuralServiceException` with the following shape:

<br />

```typescript Definition
interface MuralServiceException {
  errorInstanceId: string,
  name: MURAL_ERROR_NAME, // identifier of the specific error type, see below
  message: string
  params: map<string, any> // params defined by the specific error type, see below
}
```

We have a number of specific `MuralServiceException` types, which are outlined below:

### SignedAgreementRequiredException

Definition

```typescript SignedAgreementRequiredException
interface SignedAgreementRequiredException extends MuralServiceException {
  name: "SignedAgreementRequiredException",
  message: "End user must accept Terms of Service",
  params: {
    organizationId: string 
  }
}
```

Expected next steps:

You should generate a new Terms of Service link using the [hosted TOS link endpoint](../reference/getorganizationtoslink) and display that to your user such that they can sign the Terms of Service.

<br />

### PayoutQuoteExpiredException

Definition

```typescript SignedAgreementRequiredException
interface PayoutQuoteExpiredException extends MuralServiceException {
  name: "PayoutQuoteExpiredException";
  message: "This payout request had an expired quote. The exchange rate has been automatically updated for the effected payouts. Please retry the payout to execute the payout request with the updated payouts.";
  params: {
    expiredQuotes: ExpiredQuote[];
  };
}

interface ExpiredQuote {
  payoutId: string;
  fiatCurrencyCode: string;
  previousRate: number; // represents 1 USD equivalent in the destination currency
  newRate: number; // represents 1 USD equivalent in the destination currency
  previousFiatAmount: number;
  newFiatAmount: number;
}
```

Expected next steps

### Fiat Rail Codes

Each destination fiat currency has different requirements for the request to create [Payout Request](./payout-requests-copy). Additionally, the rail in which you send that fiat currency can affect the requirements. To identify this fiat and rail pair and the request body required, we use the concept of a "Fiat Rail Code." You will see this Fiat Rail Code referenced throughout the [Payouts API](../reference/createpayoutrequest). See below for the list of supported Fiat Rail Codes.

Note, we currently only support one rail per currency at the moment, so for now the Fiat Rail Code will be the lowercase equivalent to a given currency's [ISO 4217 currency code.](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html#:~:text=The%20first%20two%20letters%20of,and%20the%20D%20for%20dollar.)

<br />

| Fiat Rail Code | ISO 4217 Currency Code | Description                                           | Capability       |
| :------------- | :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| usd            | USD                    | USD sent to bank accounts in the United States        | Deposit / Payout |

| usd-china      | USD                    | USD sent to bank accounts in China                    | Payout           |
| eur            | EUR                    | EUR sent bank accounts in the European Union via SEPA | Deposit / Payout |
| cop            | COP                    | COP sent to bank accounts in Colombia                 | Deposit / Payout |
| ars            | ARS                    | ARS sent to bank accounts in Argentina                | Payout           |
| mxn            | MXN                    | MXN sent to bank accounts in Mexico                   | Payout           |
| brl            | BRL                    | BRL sent to bank accounts in Brazil                   | Payout           |
